# Product Overview

This is a curator-led music booking platform that connects artists/DJs, organizers/promoters, and venues/clubs. It manages who plays where, when, under what terms, and for what amount.

## Core Concept
- Not a ticketing platform, classified marketplace, or event promoter
- Trust-based ecosystem with data-driven artist-venue matching
- Professional contract and payment automation replacing WhatsApp chaos

## Key Domains
- **Booking**: Single gig mode (one-off events) and Programming mode (3-6 month venue calendars)
- **Negotiation**: Structured, limited-round (2-3 max) negotiations with pre-defined parameters
- **Contracts**: Auto-generated from templates, digital signatures, deadline enforcement
- **Payments**: Milestone-based (20-50% deposit), platform escrow, commission tracking (2-5%)
- **Trust Scores**: Reputation system affecting contract terms and platform access

## User Roles
- `artist` / `band_manager` — performers seeking gigs
- `promoter` / `organizer` — booking talent for events
- `venue_manager` — managing venue programming
- `admin` / `staff` — platform administration
- Curator (premium) — artist-venue matching expertise

## Business Rules
- Slot times are locked once committed; changes incur penalties (50% artist / 30% refund / 20% platform)
- Contracts auto-void if not signed within deadline
- Trust scores impact contract terms (low score = stricter payment requirements)
- Applications are limited based on artist rating/experience
- All feedback is internal (no public reviews)

## Primary Market
- India-focused (INR currency, IST timezone, Bangalore initial launch)
- Multi-currency support planned for international expansion
